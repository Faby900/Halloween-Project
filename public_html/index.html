        <h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h2>
        
        <p>
            I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the
            last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite 
            a hit.

            If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and
            films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
